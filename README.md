# URLink

## About the project
URLink is a multi-purpose, one-click extension tool that keeps track of websites you want to store temporarily, such as when you are researching for a project, applying to many jobs at once, or online shopping. Users can add as many sites as they want to the extension, and are able to access them regardless of how many (or how few) tabs they have open. When a user clicks on one of the sites they added to the extension, their current tab will automatically redirect to the URL associated with that site. In this way, URLink allows the user to reduce the amount of time spent switching between tasks, so they can spend more time on what really matters.

## Inspiration
As we've begun our university education throughout the past year, we've realized how chaotic, stressful, and tedious online work can be. We wanted to create a multi-purpose resource that would reduce clutter within our workspace, promoting simplicity, efficiency, and ease of access. 

## What it does
Once a user pins URLink to their browser, they are free to start browsing the web. Once they find a site they think might be useful, they can click on the extension, type in a nickname for the site, and click 'Add'. This adds the site to a list of sites stored inside the extension - it will remain there even if the user navigates to a different site, changes tabs, or reopens the browser. The user is free to click on the "Go" button beside that site name, which will automatically redirect the current tab to its URL. In this way, the user can easily access multiple sites of interest without the clutter of having several tabs open at once. Finally, if the user wants to remove any sites from their list, they can easily delete it by clicking the "X" button.
